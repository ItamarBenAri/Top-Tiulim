 * ------------
 * This service is responsible for fetching and reading data from an Excel file, specifically targeting a sheet by name.

 * 
 * Imports:
 * - `axios`: Library for handling HTTP requests.
 * - `appConfig`: Contains configuration settings, including the source URL for the Excel file.
 * - `XLSX`: Library used to read and parse Excel files.

     * @param {string} sheetName - The name of the sheet to read data from.
     * @returns {Promise<any[]>} - A promise that resolves with an array of objects representing each row in the sheet.

     * Throws:
     * - An error if the specified sheet does not exist in the Excel file.
     * 
     * Usage:
     * Primarily used to dynamically retrieve data from external Excel files, such as data configurations or content sheets.
